# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continually working to strengthen my understanding of strongly typed languages and modern JavaScript tooling. This project was built to deepen my understanding of TypeScript, including its type system, module handling, asynchronous programming, recursion, and error management. My goal was to move beyond basic syntax and build a structured application using real architectural patterns.

The software I developed is a Ward Organizer application that manages members and church callings. The system models members and leadership structures using TypeScript classes and recursive data structures. It supports asynchronous data loading, custom exception handling, and multiple interfaces for interacting with the system. The same core logic powers both a command-line interface (CLI) and a browser-based interface, demonstrating separation of concerns and reusable architecture.

My purpose in writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with TypeScript’s strict typing system, ES module configuration, recursion in hierarchical data structures, and custom error handling. I also integrated Jest testing to validate asynchronous logic and recursive tree structures. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of how TypeScript compiles to JavaScript and how runtime environments like Node.js handle module resolution.

The application demonstrates:

- TypeScript classes and interfaces

- Recursive tree traversal

- Asynchronous functions with Promises

- Custom exception creation and handling

- ES module configuration with strict compiler settings

- CLI and browser-based execution using the same core logic

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code

- Node.js (v20+)

- npm (Node Package Manager)

- TypeScript compiler (tsc)

- Web browser (for UI testing)

Programming languages and Libraries

- TypeScript (ESNext modules, strict mode enabled)

- Node.js runtime

# Useful Websites

- [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- [Node.js v25.6.1 documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#packages)
- [DOM Manipulation] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/dom-manipulation.html)

# Future Work

- Improve the browser interface with interactive member assignment

- Add persistent storage (database or JSON file saving)

- Expand the calling hierarchy to support dynamic editing

- Add input validation for user-driven assignment

- Improve unit test coverage

- Add logging system instead of console output

- Deploy a hosted version of the browser interface

# AI Disclosure

- I used AI on this project when syntax error happened due to the complexity 
  and how strict is TypeScript when exporting or importing or creating functions
  bypassing them. Merely used to correct my mistakes as I was learning the
  basics of it.
